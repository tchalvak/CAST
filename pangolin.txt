The physical appearance of pangolins is marked by large, hardened, plate-like scales. The scales are made of keratin, the same material that human hair is made of. They are often compared to walking pinecones or globe artichokes. They can curl up into a ball when threatened, with their overlapping scales acting as armour. The scales on newborn pangolins are soft but harden as they mature. The pangolin's scales are razor-sharp, and provide extra defense for this reason. The front claws of the pangolin are so long that they are unsuited for walking, and so the pangolin walks in a hunched-over manner on its hind legs, balanced by its large tail. The pangolin can also emit a noxious smelling acid from glands near the anus, similar to the spray of a skunk. Pangolins have short legs, with sharp claws which they use for burrowing.
